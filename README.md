# Crypto-Arbitrage-Detector
This project builds an automated system to detect crypto arbitrage opportunities on the Solana blockchain. By modeling token swaps as a weighted, directed graph, we apply graph-based techniques (e.g., Bellman-Ford) to identify negative cycles that represent profitable trading paths.
